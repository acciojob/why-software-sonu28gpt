		<h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
		<p>I’ve always been fascinated by how technology transforms ideas into impactful solutions, and this curiosity inspired me to pursue software development. The ability to solve real-world problems, build seamless experiences, and continuously learn in a fast-evolving field motivates me every day. For me, software development is not just about writing code—it’s about creating tools that empower others, drive innovation, and make a tangible difference in people’s lives. My passion lies in combining creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills to contribute meaningfully to the ever-changing world of technology.</p>
